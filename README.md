# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
This is C++ program in single file interface to build "Movie Ticket Booking System" using the concepts of data structures and algorithms in C++. In this code I've implemented the techniques of sorting, searching, queue, data handling and other basic C++ concepts like loops. This program has Object Oriented concepts (classes) along with DSA.
